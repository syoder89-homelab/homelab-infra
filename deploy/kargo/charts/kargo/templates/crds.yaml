                            VirtualRepoName is the name of an Artifactory virtual repository.

                            When unspecified, the Artifactory webhook receiver depends on the value of
                            the webhook payload's `data.repo_key` field when inferring the URL of the
                            repository from which the webhook originated, which will always be an
                            Artifactory "local repository." In cases where a Warehouse subscribes to
                            such a repository indirectly via a "virtual repository," there will be a
                            discrepancy between the inferred (local) repository URL and the URL
                            actually used by the subscription, which can prevent the receiver from
                            identifying such a Warehouse as one in need of refreshing. When specified,
                            the value of the VirtualRepoName field supersedes the value of the webhook
                            payload's `data.repo_key` field to compensate for that discrepancy.

                            In practice, when using virtual repositories, a separate Artifactory
                            webhook receiver should be configured for each, but one such receiver can
                            handle inbound webhooks from any number of local repositories that are
                            aggregated by that virtual repository. For example, if a virtual repository
                            `proj-virtual` aggregates container images from all of the `proj`
                            Artifactory project's local image repositories, with a single webhook
                            configured to post to a single receiver configured for the `proj-virtual`
                            virtual repository, an image pushed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-<local-repo-name>/<path>/image`, will cause that
                            receiver to refresh all Warehouses subscribed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-virtual/<path>/image`.

                            as failed.

                            If this field is set to 0, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also 0), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 1.

                            A value of 1 will cause the Promotion to be marked as failed after just
                            a single failure; i.e. no retries will be attempted.

                            There is no option to specify an infinite number of retries using a value
                            such as -1.

                            In a future release, Kargo is likely to become capable of distinguishing
                            between recoverable and non-recoverable step failures. At that time, it is
                            planned that unrecoverable failures will not be subject to this threshold
                            and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                            further condition.

                          description: |-
                            Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                            status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                            may be retried.

                            The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                            elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                            run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                            If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                            A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                            ErrorThreshold is reached.

                            discrepancy between the inferred (local) repository URL and the URL
                            actually used by the subscription, which can prevent the receiver from
                            identifying such a Warehouse as one in need of refreshing. When specified,
                            the value of the VirtualRepoName field supersedes the value of the webhook
                            payload's `data.repo_key` field to compensate for that discrepancy.

                            In practice, when using virtual repositories, a separate Artifactory
                            webhook receiver should be configured for each, but one such receiver can
                            handle inbound webhooks from any number of local repositories that are
                            aggregated by that virtual repository. For example, if a virtual repository
                            `proj-virtual` aggregates container images from all of the `proj`
                            Artifactory project's local image repositories, with a single webhook
                            configured to post to a single receiver configured for the `proj-virtual`
                            virtual repository, an image pushed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-<local-repo-name>/<path>/image`, will cause that
                            receiver to refresh all Warehouses subscribed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-virtual/<path>/image`.

                            as failed.

                            If this field is set to 0, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also 0), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 1.

                            A value of 1 will cause the Promotion to be marked as failed after just
                            a single failure; i.e. no retries will be attempted.

                            There is no option to specify an infinite number of retries using a value
                            such as -1.

                            In a future release, Kargo is likely to become capable of distinguishing
                            between recoverable and non-recoverable step failures. At that time, it is
                            planned that unrecoverable failures will not be subject to this threshold
                            and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                            further condition.

                          description: |-
                            Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                            status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                            may be retried.

                            The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                            elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                            run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                            If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                            A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                            ErrorThreshold is reached.

                            Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running

                            may be retried.

                            The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                            elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                            run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                            If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific

                            default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                            A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                            ErrorThreshold is reached.

                                    A value of 1 will cause the Promotion to be marked as failed after just
                                    a single failure; i.e. no retries will be attempted.

                                    planned that unrecoverable failures will not be subject to this threshold
                                    and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                                    further condition.

                                    Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                                    status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                                    may be retried.

                                    The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                                    elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                                    run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                                    If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                                    one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                                    default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                                    A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                                    ErrorThreshold is reached.
