# Source: kargo/charts/kargo/templates/common/cluster-roles.yaml
# This role is bound to the external webhooks server's ServiceAccount in
# project namespaces as they are created. This dynamically extends its most
# sensitive permissions on a per-namespace basis instead of granting them
# cluster-wide. Additional uses for this role are anticipated in the future.
#
# NOTE: Controller ServiceAccounts are bound to a DIFFERENT role
# (kargo-controller-read-secrets) as new project namespaces are created. That
# role has the same permissions as this one. The external webhooks server is the
# second (after the controller) component requiring permission to read secrets
# in project namespaces only, so this role was created as a generic role for
# that purpose in the likely event that still more components will require these
# permissions in the future. The controller is NOT transitioning to use this
# more generically named role because its existing kargo-controller-read-secrets
# role is publicly documented in places and is therefore hard to change.
